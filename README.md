# Panco-Food-Brand-Promotional-Flyer
This project is about promotional flyer designed in Figma for a fictional food brand named Panco. The purpose of this project is to showcase creative design skills in building brand-focused marketing content. 
🔹 Frame 1 – Brand & Discount

The opening frame highlights a 30% discount badge in a bold style to immediately catch the viewer’s eye. The central placement of the Panco panda logo strengthens brand identity, while the service timings are displayed below in a clean, professional manner. This frame balances promotional appeal with essential business information.

🔹 Frame 2 – Menu & Tagline

The second frame is designed to be interactive and engaging. It includes a QR code that customers can scan to explore the restaurant’s menu digitally. A tagline reinforces the food experience:
“Tender Juicy Meat, Saucy Spreads – Experience Heaven”.
Line spacing and emphasis ensure the tagline is impactful while remaining easy to read. Minimal geometric shapes in the background add a modern, stylish feel without distracting from the key elements.

🔹 Frame 3 – Call-to-Action & Contact

The final frame focuses on customer connection. A high-resolution burger image serves as the visual centerpiece, appealing directly to food lovers. The playful “Bite Me!!!” callout adds character, making the flyer more engaging. At the bottom, contact details and social media links are displayed for accessibility, encouraging customers to reach out or follow the brand online.
